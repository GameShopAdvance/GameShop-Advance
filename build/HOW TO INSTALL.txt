============================================================================================================

1. Technology constraints

GameShopAdvance needs some open source software to work properly:

* [Java Runtime Environment] - Java SE Runtime Environment 7
* [db4o] - database for objects, Java Version
* [joda] - Joda-Time is the *de facto* standard date and time library for Java. (2.3 release and greater)

2. How to run

2.1. On a Debian/Ubuntu based machine:

- Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.
- Open your /etc/hosts as superuser with your favorite editor
- Comment out the following line
- `127.0.1.1  <your-username>` to `#127.0.1.1 <your-username>`
- Add ` <your-ip-address> <your-username> ` just below the commented out line

To run the Application server:

```
$ cd GameshopAdvance/build/Server
$ sh ./GSA_server.sh
```

To run the Customer client:

```
$ cd GameshopAdvance/build/Client\ Customer
$ sh ./GSA_client_customer.sh
```

2.2. On a Windows based machine:

- Open a Command window

To run the Application server:
```
C:\your-home-directory> cd C:\path-to-GameShopAdvance-directory\build\Server
C:\path-to-GameShopAdvance-directory\build\Server> GSA_server.bat
```
To run the Employee client
```
C:\your-home-directory> cd C:\path-to-GameShopAdvance-directory\Client Employee
C:\path-to-GameShopAdvance-directory\build\Client Employee> GSA_client.bat
```
3. How to test:

3.1. Product list:
If you want to test the customer client, you have to insert products code and quantity to conclude a sale. Quantity is just a number, codes at this point of development are just strings but they generally follow some standard. These are the available products and them codes:

NB. Prices are not realistic.

3.2. Reserve a product:
To reserve a product you have to interact first with the Customer Client to start up the reservation, and then you have to lead to the cash-box (the Salesman Client) to proceed with the payment and then to complete the reservation.
You can only reserve a product that is over in the shop, or a product that is not already in commerce.
Here we report the principal steps needed to reserve a product:
1)Start the Customer Client;
2)Select a product, wich quantity is zero;
3)Proceed with the reservation. The Client will give the ID of the reservation (in a real context the client would give you a ticket).
4)Start the Salesman Client;
5)Select the option to complete a reservation;
6)Insert the reservation ID;
7)Proceed with the payment of the reservation.


4. Warning:

When a Client is started for the first time must be configured it from the configuration menu in the window. You should insert the IP address of the machine where the application server is running.

GSA stores products in a data-base. Since some products prices or discounts expire in time, if you experiment problems with the application it's suggested to delete the db, that will be created again at runtime. To delete the data-base simply open the server folder and remove "GSA.db".
